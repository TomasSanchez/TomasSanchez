### Hi! ðŸ‘‹
## My name is Tomas.

<br/>

I'm a Systems Engineer student, fullstack developer specialized in backend building scalable web apps. 

I've been programming for the past 2 years with a focus on python and backend development and for the past year integrating frontend technologies.

I'm currently living in Argentina looking forward to moving abroad.

<br/>

- ### What im strong with:
  
  As a fullstack web developer my stack consists of python with django backend and a decoupled react (nextJs) frontend.
  I work with django, django REST framework celery, redis, djangoChannels, postgres and more.

- ### What im not strong at:

  I'm backend first so im no javaScript expert. My frontend stack is build with NextJs, TypeScript and tailwindCSS.
  I'm familiar with node/express js as a backend framework but currently not using it.
  My go to choise is REST apis so for the time being im not using GraphQl.

- ### What im Focusing on:

  Currently im working towards deployment and devOps with Amazon Web Services and dockerizing my applications. 
  Working with aws S3, EC2, ECS, ECR, Ci/Cd with GH Actions, Nginx, Docker and Docker Compose.
